# üìã Quick Notes

The [KALI](https://www.kali.gg/) legal engineering team has drafted forms of Wrappr templates.

Delaware and Wyoming have been selected initially for "pegged" templates because of their strong contract law and DAO friendliness.

*Stateless* or "unpegged" options are also listed to allow users to set org terms without formally adopting a legal entity or jurisdiction.

## ‚úíÔ∏è Legality of Key-signatures

Jurisdictions with neutral e-signature laws that should support cryptographic key-signatures (key-sign) include the United States, Canada, China, Australia, New Zealand, Cayman Islands, and BVI. Key-sign in these jurisdictions carries the same (or similar) legal weight as handwritten signatures as long as they satisfy general requirements of the specific country‚Äôs law.

In the U.S, for example, the E-Sign Act and the Uniform Electronic Transactions Acts (UETA) define ‚Äúelectronic signature‚Äù as ‚Äúan electronic sound, symbol, or process, attached to or logically associated with a contract or record and executed or adopted by a person with the intent to sign the record.‚Äù Therefore, for electronic signatures to be qualified under U.S. law, signers have to demonstrate their intent to sign the document, and the signature must be electronically connected to the corresponding document signed and cannot be transmitted to anyone else or onto any other document.

Wrappr key-sign demonstrates user intent to be legally bound by providing smart contracts that record affirmation of text that can be reviewed on the Wrappr app. Each key-sign is logically connected to each user through their private key. These records and secure and immutable. Further, records of such agreements are identified by NFT tokenIds linked to each user account.
