## üè¢ LLC

*Anyone can attach an LLC to their wallet, multi-sig or DAO to make agreements and protect their personal assets from their web3 activities.*

### Background

The limited liability company ([LLC](https://mirror.xyz/kalico.eth/vqfVO70rkW3_D7MQA7oKlcf5yErlHt2mRUsY62hNkT0)) was a game changer for entity formation. Established in Wyoming in 1977, it offers a hybrid of partnerships and corporations that gives flexibility for members to decide on their taxation status and determine their rights largely through private operating agreements. They are typically anonymous, with only a registered agent and organizer being known to the State and general public.

Delaware extended this internet-friendly format with the creation of the [Series LLC](https://mirror.xyz/kalico.eth/PjwUyaJsHZIvJ3RfSMghcw_FS1ohrrQuXmD9XI5GJtk) concept, which allows a single filing to franchise out separate LLCs under a "master" operating agreement.

### On-chain Formation

[LexDAO](https://www.lexdao.coop/) engineers derived a technique called [Ricardian LLC](https://ricardian.gitbook.io/ricardian-llc/) that leveraged the ease of formation offered by Delaware Series LLC law but [ensured separation of concerns](https://delawarebusinesstimes.com/sponsored-content/bizinsights/future-blockchain-blockchain-ledgers-help-protect-assets-within-delaware-series-llc/) through the use of NFTs, which guarantees uniqueness for associated entities through each tokenId.

If users select Delaware or Wyoming LLC as an option through the [Wrappr app](https://app.wrappr.wtf/), they will receive a mint on an ERC-1155 token that has a sub-Series LLC agreement attached and completed through the terms of the master operating agreement with qualified code deference, stored on Ethereum and IPFS ([Delaware copy](https://del.llc.wrappr.documen.eth.link/), [Wyoming copy](https://wy.llc.wrappr.documen.eth.link/)).

Creation of a bank account and obtaining an EIN for off-chain matters can be handled by the [LexDAO Clinic](https://j6dn81d0m26.typeform.com/to/BXwMVdWX).

The maintenance of the Wrappr LLC filings, registered agent and annual State franchise tax is handled by the [KALI](https://www.kali.gg/) team for the public benefit.
