## ðŸ¤· What is Wrappr?

[Wrappr](https://app.wrappr.wtf/) is a *Legal NFT* minter and gallery. It comes with premade *[legal wrappers](https://www.paradigm.xyz/2022/06/legal-options-for-daos)* for wallets and DAOs. These protect and allow wallets and DAOs to own IRL assets and shield liabilities from interacting with crypto. The Wrappr suite also gives attorneys and creative drafters the power to plug agreements into NFTs and get paid for their awesome open source work.
