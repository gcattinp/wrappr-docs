## üó∫Ô∏è Where is Wrappr?

Wrappr is everywhere you go. Specifically, Wrappr is [multi-chain](https://github.com/kalidao/wrappr-ui/blob/main/src/constants/deployments.ts) and deployed on Ethereum, Arbitrum (including Nova), Optimism, Polygon, Gnosis, Fantom, Avalanche, Binance Smart Chain and Goerli (testnet). 

Using CREATE2 (*some code magick*), all Wrapprs will share the same address on every chain.
