# üñºÔ∏è Explore Wrapprs

The [Explore tab](https://www.wrappr.wtf/1/explore) allows users to review public mintable Wrapprs. 

After paying the minting fee, the user can send a Wrappr NFT to their chosen account, such as a DAO or multi-sig. 

These NFTs will be viewable on other NFT gallery sites such as [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/) and [LooksRare](https://looksrare.org/), as well as the user's wallet, such as [Rainbow](https://rainbow.me/).
