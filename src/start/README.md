# WTF is Wrappr?

[Wrappr](https://app.wrappr.wtf/) is a Legal NFT creation tool and gallery, starting with some pre-made ‘legal wrappers’ for wallets and DAOs. It allows lawyers and creative drafters to plug agreements into permission(able) NFTs and get paid for their awesome open source work.

# Ok, WTF is a Legal NFT?

A token that holds metadata that represents legal rights or formation filings with jurisdictions. These NFTs can also be programmed to respect transfer restrictions, hold user-specific metadata, and involve layered authorizations in order to more easily integrate with the legal system. The Wrappr.sol implementation was inspired by the Tokensoft security token implementation ([EIP-1404](https://erc1404.org/)) with the elaboration of [Compound-style governance](https://github.com/compound-finance/compound-protocol/tree/master/contracts/Governance) and the [ERC-1155 multi-token standard](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-1155/).
